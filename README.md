D3.js (aka D3, short for Data-Driven Documents) is the latest JavaScript library introduced to us as we aspire to become Data Scientists. It uses HTML5, CSS and SVG as building blocks to creating powerful data visualizations for web browsers. In our assignment, we were given Census data involving breakdowns of income, age, obesity, poverty and healthcare coverage per US state. A scatter plot using two of the subsets in the Census data were to be used. The resulting chart was also to include the abbreviation of each US state in the center of the circles.
